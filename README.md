# Offline Virtual Radio

A game-like radio experience, powered by rainmeter + python. This readme will be better documented (eventually).

Drop .mp3 files at "Radios" folder. Also add logo (.png) and playlist (.cue), all with the same name of audio file.

# Dependencies

Python with `python-vlc` installed

Tested at Windows with local python, so `PythonW` path may change
